Example path scheduler.

This example path scheduler is invoked from the iscsi-dd tool
by the call to
	iscsi_load_plugin(client.src_iscsi,
		"/usr/lib/libiscsi/plugins/roundrobin.so");

The module is simple.
It intercepts the open call that iscsi-dd does for the src/read lun,
then open a secondary connection to
the same target and installs it as a "slave context" so that it
is serviced by the same epoll fd as the master context.
(this only works on epoll capable hosts)

Then it intercepts each scsi command we try to send to the 
master context and roundrobin schedules so every second scsi
read goes to the master context and every second read goes
to the slave context.

To compile it :
gcc -shared -Wall -fPIC -I . -I include -o plugins/roundrobin.so plugins/roundrobin.c

then copy it to /usr/lib/libiscsi/plugins/


Lots of work to do still but see it as an example
